# Omni Agent Invoke Python: Codex, Claude Code, OpenClaw and DeepSeek Harness

**Invoke Codex, Claude Code (CC), OpenClaw, DeepSeek Harness (DSH), and other supported agent harnesses from Python. Powered by [Octo Runtime](https://github.com/Mininglamp-OSS/octo-runtime).**

A small, independent Python client and runnable **playboard** for a separately installed Octo Runtime Kernel. One local execution API for streaming, explicit Context, native output, cancellation and concurrent harness calls.

## Octo Runtime Is the Foundation

**[Octo Runtime](https://github.com/Mininglamp-OSS/octo-runtime) turns a collection of agent harnesses into reusable local infrastructure.** Its supervised Kernel, execution worker and Provider adapters give applications a shared execution contract while keeping Provider-specific capabilities accessible.

That is what makes this library useful: your Python application can work with multiple established harnesses through one service boundary. Canonical events provide a common format; native payloads retain Provider-specific details. Your application owns its business data and user experience, while Octo Runtime provides the execution foundation.

Explore and star **[Octo Runtime](https://github.com/Mininglamp-OSS/octo-runtime)**, read its [documentation](https://github.com/Mininglamp-OSS/octo-runtime/blob/main/docs/en/README.md), and discover its [Adapter ecosystem](https://github.com/Mininglamp-OSS/octo-runtime/blob/main/packages/README.md).

## Standalone Service, Independent Client

```text

           |
           | JSON-RPC 2.0 + NDJSON over a Unix socket

           v

```

This library has **no dependency on upstream Runtime source or SDK packages**. It implements public Kernel IPC and ships its own generated protocol identity declarations. It does not start Runtime or install/authenticate Providers. The separate Runtime service requires Node.js; the Python client uses its own language toolchain.

This is an independent community project, not an official Octo Runtime SDK. Version 0.1 targets macOS/Linux Unix sockets.

## Install and Run

Requirements: Python 3.11+ and uv, plus the independently installed Runtime and an authenticated Provider.

```sh
# Install and start the foundation service independently.
npm install -g @mininglamp-oss/octo-runtime
octo-runtime executor-kernel start

git clone https://github.com/superalsrk/omni-agent-invoke-py.git
cd omni-agent-invoke-py
mkdir -p .tmp
uv sync --python 3.11

# Use your actual endpoint for custom Runtime Homes/profiles.
export OCTO_KERNEL_ENDPOINT="$HOME/.octo-runtime/sockets/octo-runtime-executor-kernel.sock"
uv run playboard status
uv run playboard list
uv run playboard playboard --adapter codex --mode canonical \
  --prompt 'Reply with OK without using tools.' --receipt .tmp/first-run.json
```

Already running a Kernel? Skip installation/startup and point the client at its existing socket. Authenticate each Provider separately; Runtime does not sign in for you.

## Python API

```python
import asyncio
import os
from omni_agent_invoke import Client

async def main():
    async with Client(os.environ["OCTO_KERNEL_ENDPOINT"]) as client:
        async for frame in client.invoke("codex", "Say hello."):
            print(frame)

asyncio.run(main())
```

See [examples](examples/README.md) for complete runnable programs, including imports and terminal-state checks.

Four entry points make context and mode explicit:

```python
client.invoke("codex", prompt)
client.invoke_with_context("codex", prompt, context)
client.invoke_native("codex", prompt)
client.invoke_native_with_context("codex", prompt, context)
```

The first two select canonical mode; the native variants select native mode. All yield **complete HostFrames**, with canonical content in `frame.event`, native content in `frame.payload`, and terminal execution state in `frame.control`. Always consume/check the terminal state before treating an execution as successful.

Context means the Octo execution/background envelope. Explicit items merge with the selected Adapter and the default `ask` approval policy. See the typed Context, pure-text Input and image Input examples in [examples/README.md](examples/README.md). Image helpers include base64, byte length and SHA-256 metadata.

## DeepSeek Harness and Other Providers

Use Adapter ID **`dsh`** for **DeepSeek Harness (DSH)**:

```sh
uv run playboard playboard --adapter dsh --mode canonical --prompt 'Reply with OK.'
uv run playboard playboard --adapter claude-code --mode canonical --prompt 'Reply with OK.'
uv run playboard playboard --request examples/openclaw-request.json
```

DSH must be installed/configured and registered by the independently running Runtime. See the [upstream DSH Adapter guide](https://github.com/Mininglamp-OSS/octo-runtime/blob/main/packages/octo-runtime-adapter-dsh/README.md). Native mode is available only when the selected Adapter advertises it. OpenClaw uses a Context item selecting an existing Gateway Agent, such as `provider_agent_id: "main"`.

Supporting a shared execution API does not imply identical Provider capabilities. Check `list` and the upstream guide. Live verification of Codex is not a claim that every Provider was tested.

## Concurrent Harness Invocation

```sh
uv run python examples/multi_harness.py codex claude-code openclaw dsh
```

Only Codex available locally? Replace the Adapter arguments with `codex codex` to exercise two independent concurrent invocations. Examples await all tasks and report individual failures.

## Playboard and Explicit Controls

```sh
uv run playboard playboard --adapter codex --mode native --prompt 'Say hello.' --context examples/context.json
uv run playboard submit --adapter codex --prompt 'Say hello.' --receipt .tmp/submitted-run.json
uv run playboard get --ref .tmp/submitted-run.json
uv run playboard subscribe --ref .tmp/submitted-run.json --after 0
uv run playboard cancel --ref .tmp/submitted-run.json --reason user_cancelled
uv run playboard respond --ref .tmp/submitted-run.json --response answer.json
uv run playboard native-respond --ref .tmp/submitted-run.json --response native-answer.json
```

Stdout is NDJSON. Save the full RunRef for recovery. Receipts use new files and are not overwritten. `--timeout` is an execution deadline in seconds; playboard requests cancellation and observes a brief tail. Closing observation or the client never stops the Kernel or automatically cancels an accepted run.

Lost acceptance ACKs recover only by querying the original identity. Controls are never automatically replayed after an unknown outcome. See [protocol design](docs/protocol.md) for identity validation, framing, recovery and lifecycle limits.

## Local Verification

```sh
uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
uv build
node scripts/live-smoke.mjs
```

The explicit live smoke uses an existing Kernel and authenticated Codex to verify canonical/native calls, receipt lookup and replay. It does not install or stop Runtime. Evidence is recorded under `docs/live-smoke.json` without raw Provider output. No GitHub workflows or CI gates are added. Platform and live-Provider limits are recorded in [verification](docs/verification.md).
